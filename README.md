MERN JWT Authentication Project

This is a full-stack MERN application implementing secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can register, login, and access protected routes based on their role, such as user or admin. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, and JWT tokens are stored in httpOnly cookies to ensure security.
The React frontend provides a responsive interface for user interaction, while Axios handles communication with the Node.js and Express backend. Protected routes are verified using middleware that checks the JWT and user role.
This project demonstrates a modern, secure, and scalable authentication system suitable for any web application requiring user login and role-based access.<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (72)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a62e266-14f7-4795-a3b1-07225346bdab" /><img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (67)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d10f89b-196f-4d39-9ace-eaa58bd05c25" />
